This file completes Problem 1 of P8105 HW4.

## Data cleaning 

```{r clean_data}
pup_data = read_csv("data/FAS_pups.csv") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  gather(key = outcome, value = postnatal_day, starts_with("pd_")) %>%
  separate(outcome, into = c("remove", "outcome"), sep = "_") %>%
  select(litter_number, sex, outcome, postnatal_day) %>%
  mutate(sex = recode(sex, `1` = "male", `2` = "female"))
```


## Plotting data

The violin plot below shows the distribution of post-natal days for each developmental landmark.

```{r plot_data}
pup_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(postnatal_day)) %>%
  mutate(outcome = forcats::fct_reorder(outcome, postnatal_day)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = outcome, y = postnatal_day)) + 
  geom_violin()
```
